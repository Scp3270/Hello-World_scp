# Hello-World_scp
My name is Shannon, I am a freshman undergraduate student at NYIT studying Information Technology. While I have an interest in computers, I've also dabbled in music, art, soccer and debate. I'm from Trinidad, but have lived in New York for most of my life. I look forward to a diverse and collaborative work environment this semester.
